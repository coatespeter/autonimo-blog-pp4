## Setting up Django

- Firstly, I installed all the relevant packages necessary for this site. These were, Django Gunicorn, Psycopg2, Django Heroku, Django Crispy Forms, Pillow, Cloudinary, DJ Database URL, and Whitenoise.
- I then created a new Django project and app.
- I migrated the database and created a superuser.
- I created a Procfile and a requirements.txt file.
- I created an admin account.
- I then created the models for the site and migrated the database again.
- I used Elephantsql to host the database and connected it to the site vis a newly created instance.
- I linked the database to the site using the DJ Database URL package.
- I then created the views and urls for the site.
- I then created the templates for the site.
- I then created the static files for the site.
- I then created the forms for the site.
- I logged into Heroku and created a new app. This app was linked via GitHub to my code base. I was able to deploy early on Heroku and keep an eye out for any bugs during the build process by redeploying the app and making sure everything was working as expected.
- I added the necessary config vars to Heroku to connect the database and the cloudinary image hosting.
  

## Deploying to Heroku
