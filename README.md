## Wireframes

- At the beginning of the project, I made up some rough wireframes to give me an idea of what I wanted the site to look like. I used draw.io to create these wireframes. I made a wireframe for the home page and the about page.

## Post and Comment Relationship Diagram

## User Stories

- As a site user, I can view a paginated list of posts so that I can select which post I want to view.
- As a Site User / Admin, I can view comments on an individual post so that I can read the conversation.
- As a Site User I can register an account so that I can comment on a post.
- As a Site User I can leave comments on a post so that I can interact with the listings
- As a Site User I can modify or delete my comment on a post.
- As a Site Admin I can create, read, update and delete posts so that I can manage the listings.
- As a Site Admin I can create draft posts so that I can finish writing the content later.
- As a Site Admin I can approve or disapprove comments so that I can filter out objectionable comments.

## Features

- Pagination - The posts are paginated so that the user can view 6 posts per page. There is a link to the next page at the bottom of the page. When the user is not on the first page of listings, there is a link to the previous page.

- Navbar - The navbar is fixed to the top of the page so that the user can easily navigate the site. The navbar contains links to the home page, about page and the login/logout page and register page.

## Technologies Used

- HTML - The project uses HTML to create the structure of the site.
- CSS - The project uses CSS to style the site.
- JavaScript - JavaScript was used to link the buttons to functionality
- Python - The project uses Python to create the backend of the site.
- Django - The project uses Django as the web framework.
- Heroku - The project is deployed on Heroku.
- Git - The project uses Git for version control.
- GitHub - The project uses GitHub to store the code and to plan the project.
- Postgres - The project uses Postgres as the database.
- Bootstrap - The project uses Bootstrap to style the site.
- Google Fonts - The project uses Google Fonts to import the font used in the site.
- ElephantSQL - The project uses ElephantSQL to host the database.
- Draw.io - The project uses Draw.io to create the wireframe.
- Cloudinary - The project uses Cloudinary to host the images.

## Future Features

- The next feature of the site will likely be a seperate "advertise" page which will contain a form for users to submit their own listings. This will be a feature that will only be available to registered users. It will have inputs for every part of the post and the image upload.

## Setting up Django

- Firstly, I installed all the relevant packages necessary for this site. These were, Django Gunicorn, Psycopg2, Django Heroku, Django Crispy Forms, Pillow, Cloudinary, DJ Database URL, and Whitenoise.
- I then created a new Django project and app.
- I migrated the database and created a superuser.
- I created a Procfile and a requirements.txt file.
- I created an admin account.
- I then created the models for the site and migrated the database again.
- I used Elephantsql to host the database and connected it to the site vis a newly created instance.
- I linked the database to the site using the DJ Database URL package.
- I then created the views and urls for the site.
- I then created the templates for the site.
- I then created the static files for the site.
- I then created the forms for the site.
- I logged into Heroku and created a new app. This app was linked via GitHub to my code base. I was able to deploy early on Heroku and keep an eye out for any bugs during the build process by redeploying the app and making sure everything was working as expected.
- I added the necessary config vars to Heroku to connect the database and the cloudinary image hosting.
  

## Deploying to Heroku

- Firstly, I created a new app on Heroku.
- I then connected the app to my GitHub repository.
- I then added the necessary config vars to Heroku to connect the database and the cloudinary image hosting.
- In the deploy section, I was able to manually deploy the app and keep an eye out for any bugs during the build process by redeploying the app and making sure everything was working as expected.

## Bugs

![bugs](static/images/message-bug.png)

- I had a but where the user, upon recieving a message, would recieve a message not displaying with a contrast and was therefore, extremely difficult to read. This was fixed by adding the message tag seen below:

![code fix](static/images/comment-green-fix1.png)

![message tag](static/images/message-tag.png)

![message fix](static/images/comment-green.png)

- I had a bug where the deployed site, header and footer were not displaying the correct background color, therefore making the text impossible to read. I fixed this by altering the css, implementing a color via bootstrap and collecting the static files again.

- While testing the site. I found that there were contrast errors I was unaware of during the development process. I discovered this through a Wave report. I fix this by changing the color scheme of the site to be more readable and inclusive.
